## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

The MAXJsonAdapter requires that the model objects that are passed to it are subclasses of type NSObject or other object types that are key value coding compliant.

Unlike many other json adapters that serialize model objects require subclassing, this adapter on the other hand requires no specific subclassing so that other libraries which require subclassing can be easily used. 

## Installation

MAXJsonAdapter is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MAXJsonAdapter'
```
